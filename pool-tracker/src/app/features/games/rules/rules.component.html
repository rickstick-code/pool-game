  <p class="disclaimer">
    Everybody can play the game how they want, but if you need a quick rule set,
    you can use this one. These are not the official rules – they’re simple bar
    rules meant to make the game more fun.
  </p>

  <div class="rules-section">
    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>
      The goal is to sink all of your balls (halves or solids) and then the black ball (8).
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>If you sink more of one type (e.g., <em>3 solids, 1 stripe</em>), that becomes your type.</li>
      <li>If you sink an equal number (e.g., <em>1 solid, 1 stripe</em>), you keep shooting until you sink another ball. That type becomes yours.</li>
      <li>If you sink none, it’s your opponent’s turn, using the same rules.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The winner of the previous game (where either player participated) starts the next game.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="rules-section">
    <h2>Fouls</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You fail to hit your own ball type first with the white ball.</li>
      <li>You hit your opponent’s ball or the black ball first.</li>
      <li>You sink your opponent’s ball, or the white ball, at any time.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Consequence:</strong> Turn ends, opponent places the white ball anywhere.</p>
    <p><strong>Exception:</strong> On the break, it must be placed on the break line.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="rules-section">
    <h2>Winning the Game</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The black ball must be sunk last, into the opposite pocket of your previous ball.</li>
      <li>If a foul occurs while sinking the black ball (see Fouls) → you lose.</li>
      <li>If the black ball is sunk before all your other balls → you lose.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="rules-section">
    <h2>Additional Rules</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>No three-cushion/wall rule in this tournament.</li>
      <li>If the white ball touches a wall/border, you may move it away by one cue-handle thickness.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
